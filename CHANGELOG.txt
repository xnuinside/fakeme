**v0.2.2**
### Fixes: 
1. generate_data_related_to_existed_files example now works well (generation data based on already existing files).
2. Added integration tests to run examples
3. Examples are cleaned up, unworking samples moved to 'todo'

**v0.2.1**
1. Now you can define tables as Table class object if it will be more easily for you.

```python
    from fakeme import Table

    Table(name='table_name_example', schema='path/to/schema.json')

    # or 
    user_schema = [{'name': 'id'},
            {'name': 'title'},
            {'name': 'rights', 'type': 'list', 'alias': 'right_id'},
            {'name': 'description'}]
    Table(name='table_name_example', schema=user_schema)
```
samples it tests: tests/unittests/test_core.py

2. Relationships between tables was corrected 


**v0.1.0**

1. Added code changes to support Python 3.8 and upper (relative to changes in python multiprocessing module)
2. Added tests runner on GitHub
3. Autoaliasing was fixed
4. Added some unit tests
